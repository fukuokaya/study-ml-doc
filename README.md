# A machine learning-based prediction model for predicting severe neutropenia in patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel.
This is a post-hoc analysis of randomized controlled trial data to develop the XGboost-based prediction models for predicting severe neutropenia (G3 or more) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel. The Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge data is used in this study.
